# GPA-Calculator
The programming task and its specifications
-------------------------------------------
The program builds a user-interface for what year the user is in and then has classes.
A list of class is given. But the user can just change that by putting his/her class. Has to be done 
manually tho.
Then classes are in (x)Year and (Y) Semester.txt. 
 The program interactively asks the user choice and what credit each class are worth.
The total gpa and credit gets printed in a output file named output.txt.


The programming design
----------------------
I originally wanted to make it so my GPA calculator would
let me name the classes and let me pick how many course Im gonna inputput.
However that was too challeging.
Quality_points" is a dictionary that maps grades to quality points

def calculate_gpa(marks), will return the gpa.

The def calculate_grade(marks), Will take the percentage and change it to a letter grade.

The read file will read the file we picked.



 
How to run your program
-----------------------
1. Programming task: The major task is to calculate GPA.
2. The program consisists of a class and some methods to read files
 and and generate some output.
3. To run program, make sure all the "semester files" are in same directory 
as main.py and run main.py.

>>> import main
Then follow the interactive prompts. The output will be written to 
output.txt file.It has the Gpa and total credit
